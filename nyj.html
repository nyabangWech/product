      <h1>MY Summary Note on NYJ(BORN A CRIME)</h1>
      <p>
        Trevor Noah briefly describes the apartheid back in his home country a <br>
        system categorized in South Africa. He highlights the difference between <br>
        the two dominants Group the Zulu and the Xhosa. He also talks about the <br>
        minibus system as a symbol of their economic disparities.
      </p>
      <p>
        The issues that emerged from these two chapters include the legacy of <br>
        apartheid and the tension between the two dominant ethnic groups the <br>
        Zulu and Xhosa This resonates with my country, which includes the tense <br>
        tension between the two well-known tribes the Dinka and Nuer communities <br>
        leading to hundred and thousand loss of lives.
      </p>
      <p>
        Additionally, Noahâ€™s personal story underscores and highlights the risk <br>
        and Danger facing black people back in South Africa during the Apartheid <br>
        system. Back at home civilians are treated like these black individuals <br>
        who are vividly described in this novel where I would hate to say it's <br>
        like a dictatorial power over the civilians by the military, giving the <br>
        civilians no power or authority over their rights.

        Furthermore, he illustrates the co-existence of Christianity and <br>
        Traditional African societal beliefs, he also sheds light on the impact <br>
        of apartheid on family structures. Patricia's care and love traits stand <br>
        out and reflect the positive aspects of women in my society where they <br>
        could do anything for their children her strong nature and aurora <br>
        resemble the characters of women back at home. Trevor Noah highlights <br>
        the aspects of the lack of amenities in Soweto, demonstrating the <br>
        socio-economic condition in Soweto. This resonates with how poverty <br>
        affects people back in my community.
